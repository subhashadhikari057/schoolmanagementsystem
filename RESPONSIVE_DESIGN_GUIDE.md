## Responsive Design Standards Applied

### Breakpoints Used
- **Mobile**: 0px - 639px (default/base styles)
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1023px (sm, md prefixes)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (lg, xl, 2xl prefixes)

### Universal Patterns Applied

#### 1. Mobile-First Sizing
```tsx
// Applied to all interactive components
const sizeClasses = {
  sm: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs sm:px-3 sm:py-1.5 sm:text-sm',
  md: 'px-3 py-2 text-sm sm:px-4 sm:py-2 sm:text-base',
  lg: 'px-4 py-2.5 text-base sm:px-6 sm:py-3 sm:text-lg',
}
```

#### 2. Responsive Grid Systems
```tsx
// Applied to layout components
grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4
```

#### 3. Touch-Friendly Interactions
```tsx
// Applied to all interactive elements
- Minimum 44px tap targets on mobile
- Proper spacing between elements (gap-2 sm:gap-3)
- Mobile-optimized button layouts
```

#### 4. Content Adaptation
```tsx
// Applied throughout the system
- Text truncation: truncate, line-clamp-2
- Responsive spacing: space-y-3 sm:space-y-4 lg:space-y-6
- Flexible layouts: flex flex-col sm:flex-row
```

### Key Mobile Improvements
