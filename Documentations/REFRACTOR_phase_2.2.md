# 📦 REFRACTOR: Phase 2.2 – Class, Section, and Teacher Assignment Redesign

**School Management System**  
**Tech Stack**: NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Zod + Role-based Guards

---

## 🎯 Overview

This refactor separates `Section` from the `Class` model and introduces a normalized academic structure with:

- One `Class` → many `Section`s
- Teacher assignment redesigned to support:
  - Class-only
  - Class + specific section
- Clean, modular services and controllers
- Full unassignment logic by class, section, or both

---

## ✅ Key Changes in Phase 2.2

### 🔄 Prisma Schema

- Removed `section` field from `Class`
- Introduced new `Section` model with `classId` foreign key
- Updated `TeacherClass` to include optional `sectionId`

### 🧱 DTOs

- Removed `section` from `CreateClassDto` and `UpdateClassDto`
- Updated `AssignTeacherClassesDto` to accept `assignments[]` with classId and optional sectionId
- Updated `RemoveTeacherClassDto` to support optional sectionId

### 🧠 Business Logic

- Refactored `ClassService` to only manage class data
- Created `SectionService` and `SectionController` to manage section CRUD
- Updated `TeacherService` to:
  - Assign teacher to multiple class-section pairs
  - Remove class-section assignments individually or in bulk
  - Validate that section belongs to class

## 🛠️ Section API

### ➕ Create Section

`POST /api/v1/sections`

```json
{
  "name": "A",
  "classId": "uuid-of-class"
}
```

### 📥 Get All Sections

`GET /api/v1/sections`

### ✏️ Update Section

`PATCH /api/v1/sections/:id`

```json
{
  "name": "B"
}
```

### ❌ Delete Section

`DELETE /api/v1/sections/:id`

---

## 👩‍🏫 Teacher-Class Assignment

### 🔗 Assign Classes & Sections

`POST /api/v1/teachers/:id/classes`

```json
{
  "assignments": [
    { "classId": "class-uuid", "sectionId": "section-uuid" },
    { "classId": "class-uuid" }
  ]
}
```

### 👁️ Get Assigned Classes

`GET /api/v1/teachers/:id/classes`  
Returns full `class` and optional `section` per assignment

---

## ❌ Unassignment API Reference

### 1️⃣ Unassign a Specific Class (or class + section)

`DELETE /api/v1/teachers/:id/classes/:classId`  
Optional: `?sectionId=uuid`

### 2️⃣ Unassign All Assignments

`DELETE /api/v1/teachers/:id/classes`  
Optional query params:

- `?classId=uuid`
- `?classId=uuid&sectionId=uuid`

---

## ✅ Examples

### 🔄 Unassign ALL classes

```http
DELETE /api/v1/teachers/teacher-id/classes
```

### 🔄 Unassign all sections of a class

```http
DELETE /api/v1/teachers/teacher-id/classes?classId=class-uuid
```

### 🔄 Unassign specific class-section pair

```http
DELETE /api/v1/teachers/teacher-id/classes?classId=class-uuid&sectionId=section-uuid
```
