ðŸ“Œ Refer to: `/Dev docs/5. API Contract Documentation Modular, Typed, and Secure.md`

- All APIs must match structure:
  - Endpoint URL
  - HTTP method
  - Typed `Request` and `Response`
  - Error shape
  - Auth required
  - Role-specific access levels

- Suggest only documented endpoints â€” never guess.

Examples:
- If `POST /students` is defined with `CreateStudentDto`, use exactly that.
